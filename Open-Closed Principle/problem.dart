// In the example above, imagine that you would like to add a new feature such
// as PayPal Payment. Which changes would you make for it? Would you
// modify your code to add this new feature, and how?

// In order to add PayPal payment, we could simply create a PayPalPayment
// class just like the CashPayment or CreditCartPayment classes. But it is not
// the end. As you can see the PaymentService is invoked to perform apayment 
//which means that we have to modify the if-else statement and add
// a new condition to handle the PayPayPayment.
