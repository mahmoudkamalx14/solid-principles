# SOLID Principles

This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing the SOLID principles in software development. 

## What are the SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, which represents five principles of object-oriented programming and design.
These principles help developers create systems that are easier to maintain, understand, and extend over time.

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
